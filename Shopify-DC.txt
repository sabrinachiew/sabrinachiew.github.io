**Q1**

a. The AOV calculated may not have accounted for potential outliers, human errors or data processing errors in the relevant values (in this case, ‘order_amount’).

Since this is a relatively small dataset, it might be helpful to first sort the data sheet for the order_amount to look for any unusually high values. For example, shop_id 42 and 78 appear to be consistently associated with the much larger (more than 10 times) order_amount values compared to other shop_id’s. For instance, several entries for shop_id 42 seem to be from the same user_id 607 for the same order_amount and total_items values and for the same time, with duplicate entries on certain dates. 

A better way could be to use cluster analysis, or we could simply segregate the data by shop_id and graph their respective median order amount values in a box plot or scatterplot

b. Compared to the overall average, the overall median would be closer to capturing the value we are looking for. However, a good balance would be to take the average of the median values across all clusters (different shop ids).

c. ~299.68

**Q2**

a. 54 orders

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT OrderID) FROM [Orders] as o
LEFT JOIN [Shippers] as s
ON o.ShipperID = s.ShipperID
WHERE s.ShipperName = 'Speedy Express'

b. Peacock

SELECT LastName FROM [Orders] as o
LEFT JOIN Employees as e
on e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID
GROUP BY o.EmployeeID
ORDER BY COUNT(OrderID) DESC
LIMIT 1

c. Boston Crab Meat (in terms of total units sold)

SELECT ProductName FROM [Products]
WHERE ProductID in (
	SELECT ProductID FROM [Orders] as o
	LEFT JOIN [Customers] as c
	ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
	LEFT JOIN [OrderDetails] as od
	on o.OrderID = od.OrderID
	WHERE C.Country = 'Germany'
    	GROUP BY ProductID
    	ORDER BY SUM(Quantity) DESC
   	LIMIT 1 )
